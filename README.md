## Philosophy
Hi there, I am Otto MÃ¤ttas [![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/ottomattas) ! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

As an avid Artificial Intelligence researcher at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/artificial-intelligence), I am investigating how to digitalize the thing we hold dearest - our humanity. Sounds scary? Good, because I am your best bet for preventing Skynet from taking over.

On a more serious note, though. I think about thinking and how we express ourselves. For a machine, the problem can be roughly separated into two:
- gaining new knowledge about the ever-changing world around it;
- and using that knowledge under the right circumstances to take action in that ever-changing world.
###### _Important note - I am working on real-time and real-world technical applications!_

Standing on the shoulders of giants, I have already figured out and built a way for the machine to share its opinion and take action based on its knowledge. Whoop, so that's one of the tasks done!

Understanding what we do not understand yet is not that simple. Think of the question - what is love? After a heartbreak or two, you might have an idea. Now try explaining this idea to a banana.*
Even Haddaway has been asking [the very question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXWRTEbj1I) since 1994. The amount of recent cultural references and cover music indicates that the question is still very relevant. I am betting we can come up with an answer soon.

And that is when the fun starts. Have you ever dreamed of having a personal assistant like [Samanta from Her](https://www.charactour.com/hub/characters/view/Samantha.Her) or [J.A.R.V.I.S from Ironman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.)? Yeah, it could be something like that but real.


###### _\* At the time of writing, the author was not aware of bananas being able to reciprocate love. He hopes that there is or soon will be research to prove the feelings can indeed be mutual._
