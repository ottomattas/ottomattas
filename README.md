## Philosophy

### About My Business
Notice, think, reinvent. Overcoming fear becomes possible through facing it, in whatever the situation. I believe we all should start by taking notes. After understanding the often simple core of our challenge, we can seek out perspective for fresh ideas. Sometimes, following a new approach might be necessary to continue on our path towards greatness.

Here, have some magical courage to take your first step! ╰(｡^◇^｡)⊃—☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ

### About the Future
As an avid Artificial Intelligence researcher at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/artificial-intelligence), I am investigating how to digitalize the thing we hold dearest - our humanity. Sounds scary? Good that you are here reading this. I am your best bet for preventing Skynet from taking over.

On a more serious note, though. I think about thinking and how we express ourselves as humans. Furthermore, I ponder how a machine would express itself so that it becomes familiar to us. Let's separate the problem into roughly two:
- gaining new knowledge about the ever-changing world around it in real-time;
- and using that knowledge under the right circumstances to take action in that ever-changing world in real-time.

Standing on the shoulders of giants, I have figured out and built a way for the machine to share its opinion and take action based on its knowledge. Whoop, so that's one of the tasks done already!

Understanding what we do not understand yet is not that simple. Think of the question - what is love? Even Haddaway has been asking [the very question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXWRTEbj1I) since 1994. The amount of recent cultural references and cover music indicates that the question is still relevant. After a heartbreak or two, you might have a vague idea about love. Now try explaining this idea to a banana.*

I am betting we can come up with a clear answer soon. Not only will we be able to describe love but also other most profound topics about being human. And that is when the fun starts. Have you ever dreamed of having a personal assistant like [Samanta from Her](https://www.charactour.com/hub/characters/view/Samantha.Her) or [J.A.R.V.I.S from Ironman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) who understands you for you? Yeah, it could be something like that, only for real.


###### _\* At the time of writing, the author did not know about bananas' ability to reciprocate love._
